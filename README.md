# Java Spring Boot Application
Simple Java Spring Boot application that demonstrates the basic structure of a Spring Boot project and uses Gradle build tool to build the project and build.gradle file to manage dependencies.

## Overview
The Main class represents the main entry point of the application. It utilizes Spring Boot's annotations to initialize the Spring ApplicationContext and log a message upon startup.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to run the application locally:

1. Ensure you have Java and Gradle installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4. Build the project using Gradle, run "./gradlew build" command and a jar file will be created in build/libs directory.
5. Navigate to build/libs directory and you can see a jar file.
6. Run the jar file using "java -jar 'jar-file-name' ".
7. This should run the Java Spring Boot application successfully.
